# Scripts
Random collection of scripts I sometimes use, and some I didn't want to lose ðŸ¤·

**DISCLAIMER:** Worked on my machine (at one point, maybe)

## List of scripts in this repository

* setupDb.py - Create a new MSSQL image, installing some helpful extras.

### [Database](database)
* backupDatabase.sql - TSQL script to create a shrink log file, defrag indexes, and take a db backup.
